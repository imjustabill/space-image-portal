# Space Image Portal


Goals:

* Explaining the data sources (where the images come from, how to search, navigate the site, understanding how data is organized, etc)
* How we got from the raw data -> what we used in the film. Examples/tutorials for image processing. Include links to code, how to run, explain how code works. 
* Image downloads, galleries, and exploration. This will probably be the most complicated part, since we have such a large amount of data, weâ€™ll need to figure out the best way to display, search, etc (edited)

## SDSS

### Data Sources

What is SDSS?

Why did we use it?

Explain & link: 

* Images
* data files
* spectroscopic data
* redshift catalog


### Image Processing

Explain what code does

How to run code? Is it in a working state?

Known bugs

Link to github repo


### Downloads

Big Zip? Multipart? Torrent?

### Gallery

* Infinite scroller? 
* Search by location, size, etc?
* Do we need an API? Can we do it based on file name & dir structure?

### Credits

Shout outs to other people who worked on code
